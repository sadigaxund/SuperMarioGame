## :mag: Project Status
Project is: _complete_. 
Yes, I admit there are a lot of bugs to be fixed, and even more optimization and cleaning to do. However, in it's current state it has satisfied the grading rubric provided by Instructor. Furthermore, I'm more than happy to help for improvement and further development.


## :dart: Room for Improvement
These are the features that were left unimplemented due to time, little bugs that slipped unchecked and small details that I would make to improve overall performance:
  - Better data handling, everything is in Arraylist. For the map, it would be better to make a matrix then render it.
  - Smoother world traversal.
  - Better Sound handling.
  - Background song was randomly chosen, attention required.
  <br><h3>Known Bugs</h3>
  - Code for Pipe animation is glitchy, need to clean it (pun intended).
  - Ending Animation glitchy, probably because hardcoded.
  - Timer starts a new counter every time a new world is created.
  <br><h3>Whats Next?</h3> 
  - Swimming mechanics
  - There is a room for a World Editor. Everything need has already been implemented.
  - More Entities
  - More Weapons
  - More Levels...
